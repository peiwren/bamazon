Intro

This Bamazon app is a CLI app. It displays all the available products for sale, takes in orders from customers at command line console. Once the customers have placed the orders, the app should show them what they have purchased and the total cost, and reflect the remaining stock quantity. To complete the tasks, need to use the MySQL database to create the data table, and several helpful packages, mysql, inquirer, and console-table-printer to build functionalities.
